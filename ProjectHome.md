Serenity is a Meta Web Platform.

It supports different architectures, namely PHP, Python, Perl and Java, and provides the Web Administrator with powerful tools as a set of modules that are being managed by the Serenity Engine.

Serenity can act as a WebServer for a farm of projects or websites, and helps you integrate easily any kind of Meta-Module you need.

The Meta-Modules can be loaded/unloaded at runtime and provide a powerful system to improve your webspaces capabilities, modify their look-and-feels or let you customize the engine in itself.

Serenity also brings you the power of an efficient template system, accessible and customizable both through a static or dynamic scripting language.


Finally, Serenity is a state-of-the-art platform that always tries to go down the most innovative path.
You'll for instance be amazed by its web-based design features that let you know build your webspaces as a set of block-spaces that can call themselves recursively and/or interact with one another. Give it a try and learn a new way of managing websites and webapplications, and guess what, it's a cool and simple way, for a change.
